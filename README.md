# Nucleon â€“ Futuristic AR Glasses (Beta)

**Nucleon** is an experimental project focused on building lightweight and efficient augmented reality (AR) glasses for real-world use.  
This beta version aims to be simple but technically solid.

## ðŸ§ª Beta Overview

The beta device is a **basic pair of AR glasses** offering a minimal set of features:

- Weather updates  
- Speed display  
- 3D-integrated GPS navigation

This version is not packed with features. Instead, it focuses on **performance, precision, and system stability**.

## ðŸ”§ Technology

Everything in **Nucleon** is built with performance and control in mind.  
The core system is developed in **C**, with possible use of **C++** for certain components.

Why? Because C is one of the **most reliable and fastest languages** for building systems that need low-level control and high efficiency.

## ðŸ§  Control System

Nucleon aims to explore **eye-tracking controls** as its main interaction method.  
We may also experiment with **hand gesture control** in future iterations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

The goal of the beta is to create a:

- Low-cost  
- Lightweight  
- Low-power  
- Accessible AR system

All design decisions are made to ensure the device uses **as little power and resources as possible**, without sacrificing speed or stability.
